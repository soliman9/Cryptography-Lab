London is a famous and historic city. It is the capital of England in 
the United Kingdom. The city is quite popular for international tourism 
because London is home to one of the oldest-standing monarchies in the
western hemisphere. Rita and Joanne recently traveled to London. 
They were very excited for their trip because this was their first 
journey overseas from the United States.

Among the popular sights that Rita and Joanne visited are Big Ben, 
Buckingham Palace, and the London Eye. Big Ben is one of Londonâ€™s most 
famous monuments. It is a large clock tower located at the northern 
end of Westminster Palace. The clock tower is 96 meters tall. 
Unfortunately, Rita and Joanne were only able to view the tower 
from the outside.
